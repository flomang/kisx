This is a [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) subproject. Foundry manages your dependencies, compiles your project, runs tests, deploys, and lets you interact with the chain from the command-line and via Solidity scripts.

Note the out directory for build artifacts is set in the foundry.toml file. This should be the contracts folder of the svelte-frontend project.
